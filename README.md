My Test assigment including previous mistakes

-   For OOP you would need to demonstrate code structuring in meaningful classes that extend each other, so we would like to see an abstract class for the main product logic. As a result, we should see 1 main product class and 3 type-specific child classes.

Actually I didn't understand fully this comment because I did my app following MVC pattern and <br>
where I can use a lot of abstact classes I don't know. In MVC you have DI everywhere, so I rewrote as I could
