I hope that I correctly understood conditions that you can't use **frameworks** but you can use **libraries**.

PHP libaries that I used
- Validation : rakit/validation
- Router : league/route

React libraries
- Form Validation: React Hook Form
- schema: zod

P.S I know that fetching products is implemented clumsily.

I'm just not sure about the rule of what I can't use, that's why I reinvented the wheel. 

In real project, I'd use some data-fetching library React-Query,SWR etc.
